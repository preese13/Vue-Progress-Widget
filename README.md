Welcome! to the EN progress widget demo, a sandbox where we've ironed out the issues in the enrollment process for the EN employee app.  Our goal, to get users to finish their damn forms so their HR representatives don't have to bother them for months.  Our solution:  a 'progress widget' that will control the user's navigation while in the enrollment flow, while also clueing them in to how many more forms need to be filled out.

   Our story begins a long time ago, in a folder not so far away... 
(src/assets/mockData.json)

The 'progress widget' is passed varying list of forms, depending on things like:  number of dependants, coverage level, whether or not forms have been completed already etc
The form is then imported in /App.Vue
(check out that file to see what happens next)
